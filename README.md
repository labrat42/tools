# tools
Different small scripts I wrote to automate things I got annoyed of doing manually.

- change base: changes the base for default base 10 to another base, was just made to work with and learn the algorithm to do so

- deckparser: parses xmage .dck files to a .txt format readable for other programs/sites

- permanence: used to generate plannings for achats solidaires, uses a csv from framaform to distribute tasks between the participants
